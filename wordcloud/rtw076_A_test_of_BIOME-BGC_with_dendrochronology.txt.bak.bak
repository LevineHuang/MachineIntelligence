Abstract 
Aims 
Process-based models are basic tools for predicting the response of forest carbon to future climate change. The models have commonly been tested for their predictions of spatial variation in forest produc-tivity, but much less for their ability to predict temporal variation. Here, we explored methods to test the models with tree rings, using BIOME-BGC as an example. 

Methods 
We used net primary productivity (NPP) data and tree rings col-lected from five major forest types along the altitudinal gradient of Mt. Changbai, northeast China, to test local-parameterized BIOME-BGC model. We first test the model’s predictions of both spatial (Test 1).and temporal changes (Test 2).in productivity. Then we test if the model can detect the climatic factors limiting forest productiv-ity during historical climate change, as revealed by dendroclimatic analyses (Test 3). 

Important Findings 
Our results showed that BIOME-BGC could well simulate NPP of five forest types on Mt. Changbai, with an r2 of 0.69 between mod-eled and observed NPP for 17 plots along the altitudinal gradient (Test 1). Meanwhile, modeled NPP and ring-width indices were cor-related and showed similar temporal trends for each forest type (Test 2). While these tests suggest that the model’s predictions on spatial and temporal variation of NPP were acceptable, a further test that relate the correlations of modeled NPP with climate variables to the correlations of ring widths with climate (Test 3).showed that the model did not well identify the climatic factors limiting historical productivity dynamics for some forest types, and thus cannot reli-ably predict their future. Both dendrochronology and BIOME-BGC showed that forest types differed markedly in the climate factors limiting productivity because of differences in tree species and cli-mate condition, and thus differed in responses to climate change. Our results showed that a successful prediction of spatial NPP pat-terns cannot assure that BIOME-BGC can well simulate histori-cal NPP dynamics. Further, a correlation between modeled NPP and tree-ring series cannot assure that the limiting climatic factors for productivity have been correctly identified by the model. Our results suggest the necessity to test the temporal predictions of pro-cess-based models in a more robust way, and further integration of dendrochronology and biogeochemistry modeling may be helpful for this purpose.

INTRODUCTION 
Fang et.al. 2001; Goodale et.al. 2002; Piao et.al. 2009). Forests Monitoring, understanding and predicting the response of for-in the mid and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere est carbon balance to climate change have been a central issue have been recognized as a large carbon sink (Dixon et.al. 1994; Ciais et.al. 1995; Fang et.al. 2001; Schimel et.al. 2001; Fang et.al. 2006; Piao et.al. 2009). However, this huge carbon pool and sink may change into a carbon source as a result of cli-mate and land-use changes (Houghton 2005; IPCC 2007; Peng et.al. 2009). Northeast China is the most important for-est region in China, occupying ca. 35% of the forest area and 40% of the forest biomass of China (Fang et.al. 2001). Recent studies have found conflicting results on the carbon balance for forests in northeast China, with some studies identifying them as a substantial carbon sink (Fang et.al. 2001; Tan et.al. 2007; Peng et.al. 2009), while others identified them as car-bon sources (Piao et.al. 2009). This region has experienced the most drastic climatic warming over the past decades in China 
(e.g. Ren et.al. 2005), thus there is no disagreement as to the urgent need to understand the response of forest carbon to climate changes in northeast China (Shao et.al. 2001; Ni 2002; Wang et.al. 2008; Peng et.al. 2009). 
Ecological models are indispensable tools for estimating and understanding the responses of net primary productivity (NPP) to climate change (Field et.al. 1998; Turner et.al. 2004; Norby et.al. 2005; Piao et.al. 2009). Compared to satellite-based models (e.g. Field et.al. 1998; Piao et.al. 2005), process-based models have the advantage to predict the responses of ecosystems to future climate changes. They also represent powerful tools for understanding the complex (and interac-tive) effects of climate change and elevated atmospheric CO2 (Cramer et.al. 2001; Peng et.al. 2009; Piao et.al. 2009; Girardin et.al. 2011). However, a common challenge with process-based modeling at larger scales is model validation because field observations are limited (Peng et.al. 2009), especially the lack of data on long-term variation of forest productiv-ity. Consequently, whereas many studies have tested the abil-ity of process-based models to predict spatial NPP patterns, much fewer have evaluated the models’ ability to simulate temporal variation in forest productivity (e.g. Rathgeber et.al. 2003; Cienciala and Tatarinov 2006; Ueyama et.al. 2010). But it is clear that the models’ predictions of forests responses to future climate change will be reliable only if they can rea-sonably simulate historical variation in forest productivity. In a study that assessed 16 process-based models, Keenan et.al. (2012) found that none of the models could stimulate observed inter-annual variability of carbon flux satisfactorily, highlighting the critical importance for biogeochemistry mod-els to be tested for their predictions on temporal dynamics. 
Three types of field-based data were generally used to vali-date the modeled NPP time series: (i) repeated measurements of permanent plots (e.g. Cienciala and Tatarinov 2006), (ii) carbon flux data estimated from the eddy covariance method 
(e.g. Law et.al. 2004; Ueyama et.al. 2010; Mitchell et.al. 2011), and (iii) tree rings (e.g. Hunt et.al. 1991; Malmstr.m et.al. 1997). The former two data sources, despite many advan-tages, are available from limited sites where long-term studies have been conducted. Tree rings are sensitive records of long-term responses of forest growth to historical climate changes (Fritts 1976; Esper et.al. 2002), and can be easily sampled from various forest types in remote sites. Consequently, dendro-chronology has long been widely used in climate change stud-ies (e.g. Fritts 1976; Esper et.al. 2002; Lara et.al. 2005; Wang et.al. 2006). Meanwhile, ring widths have proved a good proxy of forest NPP because tree radial growth is proportional to annual NPP (e.g. Graumlich et.al. 1989; Rathgeber et.al. 2003; Kong et.al. 2012; Li et.al. 2014). As a result, tree rings have long been used to validate the NPP time series predicted by biogeochemistry models (e.g. Malmstr.m et.al. 1997; Pietsch and Hasenauer 2002; Rathgeber et.al. 2003; Su et.al. 2007). However, in previous studies, tree-ring chronologies were simply compared and correlated with modeled NPP series. In fact, dendrochronology also provides well-established meth-ods to analyze the response of forest growth to historical cli-mate variability (e.g. Fritts 1976), but these advantages have not yet been fully utilized in the validation of process-based models. 
In dendrochronology, it is a common practice to analyze ring widths in relation to climate of different seasons to detect the limiting climatic factors for forest growth (Fritts 1976), which has proved effective in identifying different responses of forests to historical climatic variability (e.g. Lara et.al. 2005; Wang et.al. 2006; Chang et.al. 2009). Here, we utilized this analysis to further test process-based modeling. If the mod-els have well simulated the historical forest dynamics, then the modeled NPP time series should reveal similar relation-ships with climate variables in different seasons as tree-ring chronologies do. If biogeochemistry models fail to detect the limiting climatic factors for forest productivity in the past, it is unlikely that the models can predict the future reliably. Clearly, this test is also useful when the modeled NPP series are validated using other data sources (e.g. flux tower.data). 
In this analysis, we utilize the widely used process-based model BIOME-BGC to explore how to better validate car-bon process modeling with dendrochronology. We tested the model (when constrained by local parameters) from three aspects as follows. 
Test 1: the model should be able to predict both the NPP of 
various forest types and the spatial NPP patterns along 

environmental gradients (e.g. Peng et.al. 2009). Test 2: model-estimated annual NPP should show similar tem-
poral trends to tree-ring chronologies, and they should 

be significantly correlated (e.g. Rathgeber et.al. 2003). Test 3: the annual NPP series predicted by BIOME-BGC 
should also show similar correlations with seasonal 
climate as tree-ring chronologies do. 

Mt. Changbai is the highest mountain (2691 m) in northeast Asia and harbors all the latitudinal forest zones in north-east China along its altitudinal gradient. Here, we used field NPP observations along the altitudinal gradient, and tree rings sampled from different forest types on Mt. Changbai, to determine if parameterized BIOME-BGC can simulate both altitudinal and temporal variation in productivity. We also examined how different forest types differed in climatic control of inter-annual variations of productivity, which is important to reduce the uncertainties in modeling regional carbon balance in response to climate change (Law et.al. 2004; Ouyang et.al. 2014). 
MATERIAL AND METHODS 

Study.area 
Mt. Changbai (41°43′–42°26′N, 127°42′–128°17′E) is situated at the border between northeast China and North Korea. The climate in this region is characterized by warm summers, cold winters, abundant precipitation and a short growing season, largely controlled by the East Asian monsoon. With increas-ing altitude from mountain foot to top, mean annual tem-perature decreases from 4.9°C to .7.3°C and mean annual precipitation increases from 600 to 1340mm (Zhang et.al. 1980). Major soil types include dark-brown forest soil (<1000 m), brown needle-leaf forest soil (1000–1800 m), calcic cher-nozems (1800–2000 m) and tundra soil (>2000 m). As a result of the climatic and soil gradients, different forest types are distributed along the altitudinal gradient of Mt. Changbai. 
(i) 500–1100 m: mixed broad- and needle-leaved forest (MBN), composed of Pinus koraiensis and broadleaf species such as Quercus mongolica, Tilia spp., and Betula and Populus forest (BPF); (ii) 1100–1700 m: evergreen needle-leaved for-est (ENF), composed of Picea jezoensis and Abies nephrolepis, and deciduous needle-leaved forest (DNF) dominated by Larix olgensis; (iii) 1700–2000 m: Betula ermanii forest (BEF) (Wang et.al. 1980). With large climate gradient and different vegetation types along its altitudinal gradient, Mt. Changbai provides an ideal template to examine the responses of forest ecosystems in northeast China to both spatial climatic gradi-ents and temporal climate changes (Shao et.al. 2001; He et.al. 2005; Wang et.al. 2009; Fang et.al. 2012). 

NPP and tree-ring.data 
To test the ability of BIOME-BGC to model the spatial variation in NPP, we compiled literature data reported for different for-est types and altitudes on Mt. Changbai. For each plot where NPP was measured, we recorded forest type, species composi-tion, total (above and below ground) NPP, geographic coordi-nate (latitude, longitude, altitude), local topography (aspect and slope), and soil variables needed for the model. Data for 17 plots distributed from 590 m to 1940 m were obtained (Li et.al. 1981; Luo 1996; Wang 2006), covering the five major forest types on Mt. Changbai with at least three observations from each forest type (BEF, DNF, ENF, BPF and.MBN). 
To test the temporal variation of modeled NPP, we selected a typical site from each forest type to sample tree-ring cores (Table.1), based on previous studies in Mt. Changbai (e.g. Wang et.al. 2008; Wang et.al. 2009; Zhu et.al. 2010). In the summer of 2007, 25 to 30 canopy-layer trees were randomly selected at each site, and two tree-ring cores at breast height 
(1.30 m) were extracted from two vertical directions, follow-ing standard dendrochronological techniques. 
All cores were mounted and sanded with successively finer grades of sandpaper until annual rings could be easily dis-tinguished. Tree rings were cross-dated visually using the skeleton plot method (Schweingruber 1996), and the ring widths were measured with an accuracy of 0.001mm using the LINTAB5 measurement system and TSAP software (Frank Rinn Co. Ltd, Germany). The quality of cross-dating and measurement was checked by cross-correlation analysis using the software COFECHA (Holmes 1983). Some cores were excluded because they could not be well measured or cross-dated, and the remaining 167 cores from 126 trees were used for further analysis. 
We constructed a chronology for each of the five forest types, using 30–38 cores from each forest type (Table.1). The growth trends (decreasing ring-width with increased age) were removed from raw ring-width data with spline or expo-nential curves, which was necessary for examining the high-frequency growth variation associated with climate changes (Fritts 1976). A.residual chronology that maximized the cli-matic signal was then created for each forest type using the ARSTAN software (Cook and Holmes 1986). The qualities of the chronologies were evaluated with their standard devia-tion, mean sensitivity (MS) and expressed population signal (EPS) (Table.1). 

The BIOME-BGC model and its parameterization 
BIOME-BGC is a biogeochemical model that simulates the storage and fluxes of water, carbon and nitrogen in terres-trial ecosystems from single plot to regional and global scales (Kimball et.al. 2007). The model has been successfully applied and validated over a number of biomes, spatial scales and cli-mate regimes, including various forest ecosystems from differ-ent continents (White et.al. 2000; Turner et.al. 2004; Cienciala and Tatarinov 2006; Kang et.al. 2006; Su et.al. 2007; Ueyama et.al. 2010). Details of the model have been presented by pre-vious studies (e.g. White et.al. 2000; Thornton et.al. 2002), and thus are described only briefly.below. 
The primary ecological processes modeled by BIOME-BGC are photosynthesis, evapotranspiration, respiration (includ-ing autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration), the allocation of photosynthetic assimilates, decomposition and mortality. Model simulation requires daily climate data, information for the general environment (soil, vegetation and site conditions) and parameters describing the eco-physiological characteris-tics of the vegetation. In BIOME-BGC, NPP is defined as the daily difference between gross photosynthesis and autotrophic respiration. Photosynthesis is calculated separately for sunlit and shaded canopy components using a modified form of the Farquhar biochemical mode (Farquhar and Von Caemmerer 1982). Autotrophic respiration is the sum of maintenance res-piration and growth respiration of different parts of plant (can-opy, stem and roots). Maintenance respiration is calculated from a base respiration rate adjusted for tissue nitrogen con-centration and temperature. Growth respiration is calculated as a constant proportion of new tissue carbon construction for

woody and non-woody tissue types. In this analysis, we used the version 4.2 of BIOME-BGC model, which is available at: http://www.ntsg.umt.edu/project/biome-bgc. 
BIOME-BGC requires a set of eco-physiological parameters to characterize the biome to be simulated (White et.al. 2000). In this study, the 34 eco-physiological parameters for each for-est type came from three sources (see online supplementary Appendix 1). (i) In a previous study, we measured specific leaf area, leaf carbon: nitrogen (C:N) ratio and live wood C:N ratio for dominant species of the five forest types in Mt. Changbai (Fan 2011). A.previous sensitivity analysis showed that, for woody biomes, the predicted NPPs of BIOME-BGC were very sensitive to variation in specific leaf area and leaf C:N ratio (White et.al. 2000), and thus local measurements of these parameters are preferred. (ii) Some parameters were collected from the literature (see online supplementary Appendix 1). Whenever possible, we used data from the same forest type on Mt. Changbai or northeast China. In some cases we also used literature values for similar tree species under similar cli-mates. (iii) For other parameters, we used the default values of BIOME-BGC.4.2. 
BIOME-BGC did not provide the eco-physiological param-eters for MBN. For this forest type, we used the method adopted by Kang et.al. (2006). We set the eco-physiological parameters separately for needle-leaf species and decid-uous broadleaf species (i.e. MBN-PK and MBN-DB in online supplementary Appendix 1), and ran the model sepa-rately. Then the NPPs of needle- and broadleaf species were averaged based on their relative proportions to obtain the stand NPP. 

Meteorological data and model simulations 
Daily records of maximum and minimum temperatures and precipitation for the period of 1958–2006, from the meteor-ological station at the foot of Mt. Changbai (590 m), were obtained from the China National Climatic Data Center. These data were used to estimate the meteorological varia-bles at each simulation site, using the microclimate simulator MT-CLIM 4.3 (http://www.ntsg.umt.edu/project/mtclim) to correct for differences in elevation, slope and aspect between the meteorological station and the simulated sites (Thornton and Running 1999; Thornton et.al. 2000). Other climatic vari-ables needed by the BIOME-BGC (e.g. shortwave radiation, vapor pressure deficit and day length) were also estimated with MT-CLIM 4.3. Historical atmospheric CO2 concentra-tions data were obtained from the Mauna Loa observation station (MLO; 19.5°N, 155.6°W) of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) observation station. MLO is located in the Hawaii islands of the Pacific Ocean. The undisturbed air, remote location and minimal influences of human activity at MLO are ideal for monitoring global change in atmosphere CO2. Consequently, the MOL CO2 records are widely used in process-based modeling studies. 
The model simulation included two stages: spin-up simula-tion and normal simulation. In the spin-up run, the model was run to steady-state ecosystem carbon and nitrogen pool conditions, using historical meteorological data and fixed pre-industrial atmospheric CO2 concentration (294.8ppm) and nitrogen deposition rate (0.0001kg N m2 year.1). The spin-up procedure was completed until a steady state was reached among climate, vegetation, ecophysiology, soil organic matter and nutrient pools (Thornton et.al. 2002). The endpoint of the spin-up run was used as the initial conditions for subsequent normal model simulation. In the normal simulation stage, we simulated the historical NPP dynamic of each modeling site to obtain the predicted values used for model validation (see below), using metrological data and CO2 concentration from 1958 to 2006. We did not model NPP’s response to future cli-mate scenarios because the modeling results for three forest types did not pass the final test we proposed (see Results), which prevented a reliable prediction of the future. 

Model validation 
As mentioned in the Introduction, we tested BIOME-BGC modeling from three aspects. 
i) To test the model’s ability to simulate spatial variation in NPP, we ran BIOME-BGC for each of the 17 NPP observa-tion plots. Since ordinary least squares regression tends to underestimate regression slope, we used standard major axis regression to fit modeled and observed values. If the r2 between observed NPP and modeled NPP (averaged over 1958 to 2006 for each plot) was sufficiently high, and the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the regression slope and intercept included 1 and 0, respectively, then the model prediction was judged to be acceptable. We also examined whether BIOME-BGC could predict the NPPs for different forest types, we tested whether the modeled NPPs were significantly different from observed values using the plots from each forest type. 
ii) We used tree-ring chronologies to test the model’s ability to simulate the historical variation in forest productivity. For this test, we ran BIOME-BGC for each forest type at the site where the tree rings were sampled. We compared the modeled annual NPP series with tree-ring chronolo-gies to determine whether they showed similar temporal trends and the extent to which they were correlated (e.g. Rathgeber et.al. 2003). 
iii) In addition to the commonly used method, we further correlated both the modeled annual NPP series and tree-ring chronologies to seasonal climate and yearly CO2 concentrations during the period of 1958 to 2006. The climatic variables used in the analysis included mean temperature and total precipitation of the current year’s spring (March to May), summer (June to August) and au-tumn (September to November), as well as temperature and precipitation of the four seasons in the previous year. The latter climatic variables are necessary because many dendrochronology studies have shown that the climate in the previous year can have strong influences on for-est growth (e.g. Fritts 1976; Wang et.al. 2006; Chang et.al. 2009). For this analysis, seasonal climatic variables were calculated from the daily temperature and precipitation data used in BIOME-BGC modeling. We also repeated the analyses using monthly temperature and precipitation. Since the results were similar, we reported only the results based on seasonal climate variables for simplicity. 
When examining whether modeled annual NPP showed simi-lar correlations with climate as tree-ring chronologies do, we did not simply focus on the individual correlations that were significant. To avoid the potential limitations of correlation analysis (see Discussions for details), we regressed the correla-tions of modeled NPP with different climate variables against that of ring-width indices. We used this method to examine whether BIOME-BGC had identified the limiting (and non-limiting) climatic factors for forest productivity during histori-cal climate changes, as revealed by tree-ring chronologies. 
RESULTS 

Temporal variation in climate and tree-ring.width 
Annual mean temperature increased by 0.01°C/year during the last decades at lower altitudes of Mt. Changbai, but annual precipitation did not changed significantly over time (Fig..1). 
The residual chronology for each forest type had an EPS >0.85 and a MS >0.15 (Table.1), which were high enough for a good examination of forest growth in response to climatic variation (Wigley et.al. 1984; Rolland 1993; Wang et.al. 2006). The MS was generally higher for forest types distributed at higher altitudes while lower for low-altitude forest types. 
Validation of BIOME-BGC across altitudinal gradient and forest.types 
Field-observed NPP in Mt. Changbai decreased significantly with increasing altitude (Fig..2a). This spatial pattern was well modeled by BIOME-BGC, with simulated and observed NPP had an r2 of 0.69 (Fig..2b). The 95% CIs of the slope (0.62–1.14) and intercept (.24 to 244).included 1 and 0, respectively, and thus the model prediction of spatial NPP pattern was satisfied. 
The mean observed NPP was 594.66g C m.2 yr.1 for plots from MBN and was 636.05g C m.2 yr.1 for BPF, 489.15g C

m.2 yr.1 for ENF, 459.41g C m.2 yr.1 for DNF, and 222.3g C m.2 yr.1 for BEF (Fig..2c). For each forest type, modeled and observed NPP values were similar and not significantly dif-ferent (P > 0.05), indicating that the NPPs of different forest types were also well predicted. 
Validation of the temporal dynamics predicted by BIOME-BGC 
The annual NPP series simulated by BIOME-BGC were sig-nificantly (P <.0.05) correlated with tree-ring chronologies for DNF, ENF and BPF (Fig..3), with a correlation coefficients (r) between 0.29 and 0.37. For the other two forest types (BEF and MBN), the correlations between model NPP and ring-width series were marginally significant (P =.0.05 and 0.06, respectively). Despite differences in some years, the overall temporal trends were roughly similar between ring-width indices and model NPP estimates. 
Both modeled annual NPP and ring widths were signifi-cantly correlated with current-year summer temperature for DNF and ENF (Table.2), but the correlation was negative for ENF while positive for DNF. For ENF, both modeled NPP and ring-width series were also closely correlated with summer temperature and autumn precipitation of the previous year. For other forest types, the climatic variables that were signifi-cantly correlated with modeled NPP and ring-width indices were generally different. 
The correlations of modeled NPP with each climatic/CO2 variable were positively and significantly related to the cor-relations between ring-width and each climatic/CO2 variable, for DNF and ENF but not for the other three forests (Fig..4). Thus, only DNF and ENF passed the Test 3 we proposed, while other forest types did.not. 
DISCUSSION 
The ability of the models to predict spatial vs. temporal variation 
Some studies have used ecological models to investigate the responses of forest ecosystems to future climate changes on Mt. Changbai or in northeast China, based on gap mod-els (e.g. Shao et.al. 2001; He et.al. 2005) or biogeochemis-try models (e.g. Gao and Zhang 1997; Ni 2002; Peng et.al.

However, this assumption was not supported by the pre-

2009). These studies not only improve our understanding of forests in northeast China in response to climate change but have also well modeled the spatial pattern of forest productivity in this region. However, few of these models have been tested for their predictions on historical dynam-ics because of the lack of validation data. Thus, these stud-ies actually predicted future forest dynamics based on an implicit assumption that: if a model can well-predict spatial patterns along climatic gradients, then it can also predict forest responses caused by temporal climate change, and thus the model can be used to predict the future. In fact, this implicit assumption is widely seen in ecological mod-eling when long-term field observations were not available 
(e.g. Araujo and Guisan 2006). 
only focusing on a few significant correlations. For instance, some studies have shown that the correlations between ring widths and climatic variables changed regularly with lati-tude or altitude, indicating that the limiting climatic factors for forest growth change along latitudinal and altitudinal gradients (e.g. Lara et.al. 2005; Chang et.al. 2009; Sidor et.al. 2015). The logic underlying the new test (Test 3).we propose is as follows. (i) In Table.2, stronger correlations between ring-width and climatic variables generally (but not neces-sary) suggest that the climatic variables are stronger limiting factors for forest productivity, whereas weaker correlations generally suggest the climatic variables are less limiting. This is a basic assumption of dendroclimatic analysis (Fritts 1976; Lara et.al. 2005; Chang et.al. 2009). (ii) If BIOME-BGC has correctly identified both the limiting and non-limiting cli-matic factors for forest productivity during historical climate change, then the correlations of model NPP to various cli-mate variables should be similar to that of tree-ring chronol-ogy (Fig..4). 
In our results, the correlations between modeled NPP and ring-width series were significant or at least marginally

significant for each forest type, and the overall temporal trends were roughly similar between ring-width indices and model NPP estimates (Fig..3, Test 2). With only Test 2, it may be concluded that the modeled NPP series were acceptable for all the forest types (e.g. Rathgeber et.al. 2003; Wu et.al. 2014). However, our further analysis (Fig..4, Test 3).revealed that the responses (correlations) of modeled NPP to seasonal climates were largely similar to that of ring widths for only DNF and ENF, but not similar enough for the other three forests. This suggests that a significant correlation between modeled NPP and ring-width, however, cannot assure that process-based models have correctly identified the climatic variables limit-ing forest productivity. 
Different response of forest productivity to climate change among forest.types 
Forest productivity may respond to climate change differ-ently, depending on local environmental condition and forest type (Law et.al. 2004; Lara et.al. 2005; Su et.al. 2007; Chang et.al. 2009; Ouyang et.al. 2014). However, most of these find-ings were obtained based on either dendroclimatic analyses or biogeochemistry modeling alone, instead of based on the two approaches simultaneously. 
In this analysis, we related both ring-width and modeled annual NPP to seasonal climate, and found that they showed similar responses to historical climate for some forest types. For instance, both ring-width and modeled NPP were positively correlated with current-year summer temperature instead of precipitation for DNF (Table.2). This is consistent with previous studies in northeast China showing that the growth of subal-pine DNF is limited by growing season temperature (Yu et.al. 2005; Chang et.al. 2009). In contrast, both ring-width and NPP series of ENF were negatively associated with current summer temperature. At the same time, both ring widths and modeled NPP of ENF were positively related to the previous year sum-mer temperature and autumn precipitation (P <.0.1). Thus, our results indicated that BIOME-BGC modeling could also capture the “lag effect” commonly observed in dendrochronology: the climate in a previous year can have strong effect on current-year forest growth (e.g. Fritts 1976; Zeng et.al. 2012). In this study, the tree rings of DNF and ENF were sampled from simi-lar altitudes (1500 and 1400 m, respectively) and thus were under similar climate condition. Consequently, the above-mentioned different climatic control between DNF and ENF should be mainly caused by difference in tree species instead of climate. Because these differences were revealed by both ring widths and modeled NPP, our results provide robust evidence that forest type is a major cause of difference responses to cli-mate change (Law et.al. 2004; Ouyang et.al. 2014). 
For other forest types (BEF, BPF and MNB), dendroclimatic analyses also suggest that they differ in the climatic control of temporal productivity dynamics (Table.2). These differences

Abbreviation: RWI, ring-width indices. 
should be related to differences in both forest types and cli-mate, because these forests are distributed at different alti-tudes (Table.1). Even for a same forest type, the response of forest productivity to climate variability may change regu-larly along latitudinal and altitudinal gradients. This has been found in either dendroclimatic or biogeochemistry modeling studies (Rathgeber et.al. 2003; Lara et.al. 2005; Chang et.al. 2009; Sidor et.al. 2015), highlighting that local climate and site condition is another major factor driving different responses to climate change (Su et.al. 2007; Ouyang et.al. 2014). 
Thus, different forest types may respond to historical cli-mate change in rather different ways, even within a single mountain in northeast China. Considering this, it is not easy to believe that a model can correctly predict the large-scale car-bon dynamics in the future, if the model has not been tested for its ability to identify the limiting climatic factors of pro-ductivity during historical changes. Our results suggest that a further integration of dendrochronology and process-based modeling will provide a tool to better understand the different response of forest productivity to climate change.
